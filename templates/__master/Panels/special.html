	<p>
	Lots of people know us for our incredible good looks (and the watches that you can buy on this-here-website).
	</p>
    
    <p>
    We also have a dark secret: We love customizing watches for companies, non-profits and personal events. If you have any interest in customizing a set of watches, whether simply engraving the back of the watches you see on the site or even completely designing a watch for yourself, let us know by emailing Aaron (aaron@Modifywatches.com). Our minimum order is 50 Modify Watches for engraving and 100 for a full customization.

    We have worked with some incredible organizations to create cool gifts and products that enhance their brand. Seriously. Our partner list includes a pre-IPO Social Network; an Internet Search giant; Adult Swim, the Pac-12, <a href="http://forums.televisionwithoutpity.com/lofiversion/index.php/t3136506-1850.html" target="_blank">and so on</a>.

    	<center><b>Case Study: Pieces of Sheet</b></center>
        </p>
        
        <p>
        	Roshan Bhula, CEO and co-founder of <a href="http://www.piecesofsheet.com" target="_blank">Pieces of Sheet</a>, commissioned us to create a cool product that he could use to generate buzz at launch. He provided the company's logos and minimal guidance â€“ "Make our Sheet look Sweet".
        </p>

		<p>
Ashil, Modify's Creative Guy, then took that logo and created a few different ideas. The goal at this point was not simply to create a finished product, but rather to give Roshan and his team some ideas of what a Sheet-lover watch might look like.
